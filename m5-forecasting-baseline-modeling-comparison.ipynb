    "\n",
    "Walmart, Whole Foods, Amazon, and other large department stores maintain millions of products and record millions of transactions every day. In order to optimize the profit, store manager must keep balance between inventory, current demand, and they are relying on accurate sales prediction to make informed decisions. Most of the existing sales predictions depends on statistical inference from trends. previous forecasting methods requires a lot of extra information from customers to product detailed information and requires customer and product attribute analysis. In this project we will try to build simplified model to predict the unit sales based historical sales record. Our data is from Kaggle M5 Competition, we will use combination of statistical a machine learning including Deep Neural Networks to solve this exciting case study.\n"

    "# Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the project is to precisely forecast the unit sales for Walmart USA. Incorrect or misleading forecasts on product sales could trigger opportunity and revenue loss for Walmart. For instance, if analyst team failed to estimate the demand for different product for different categories at different stores located in various states during long weekends or thanksgivings, they may lose opportunity to attract thousands of customers and potentially lose millions of dollars of revenue.  We will build a model that will assist the business analyst and manager to improve planning the inventory distribution, inventory storage solutions, promotions and offer decisions.\n"

    "Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.\n",
